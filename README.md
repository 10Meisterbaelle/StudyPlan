## Compiling the app

To compile the app, you need to have the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed.
This tutorial only covers compiling for Android. If you would like to compile the app for iOS, figure it out yourself.

Execute this command in your terminal / command prompt / PowerShell:
```
flutter build apk
# replace flutter with the path to your flutter SDK
```

The compiled apk file will be located in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk.
